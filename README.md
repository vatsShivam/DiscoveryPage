# Getting Started with the app
Just clone the project and than run command npm i
and than npm start than your application will start
# toggle Option 
There is  option for the users to switch to dark mode and light mode whatever the mode they want
# App Performance 
I have used the concept of Lazy Loading which makes the component asynchronous .and all the section of the 
page are aynchoronous so the component didnot have to wait for another component  So that component which has small 
amount of data that should be shown first .So users will see the interactions with the web page very quickly
It makes our application 60 % faster than compared to normal 
# search option
I have given the search option in which you can search accoring to player_name and country you can write your entry in the input box and than on OnBlur 
there is function call that will return array that will matches your search 
and if you choose No filter you will show normal data 
 # Infinite  Scroll 
 Instead of showing all amount of data one time this web application show only 6 data at one time and than when you scroll another six data is shown 
 this will continute till there is no data in the array and at last there is a message that "you have seen all items"
 This also makes our web page very faster
